    <p>
        A treadmill is a device generally for walking, running or climbing while 
        staying in the same place. treadmills are not used to harness power, but 
        as exercise machines for running or walking in one place. Rather than the 
        user powering the mill, the machine provides a moving platform with a wide 
        conveyor belt driven by an electric motor or a flywheel. The belt moves to 
        the rear, requiring the user to walk or run at a speed matching that of the 
        belt. The rate at which the belt moves is the rate of walking or running. 
        Thus, the speed of running may be controlled and measured. The more expensive, 
        heavy-duty versions are motor-driven (usually by an electric motor). The simpler, 
        lighter, and less expensive versions passively resist the motion, moving only when 
        walkers push the belt with their feet.

    <h2>Advantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Enable the user to set up an exercise regime indoors that can be adhered to 
            irrespective of the weather.</li>
        <li>Treadmills have programmes such that the user can simulate terrains, 
            e.g. rolling hills, to provide accurate, programmed, exercise periods.</li>
        <li>User progress such as distance, calories burned, and heart rate can be tracked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Costs of purchase, electrical costs, and possible repair are significantly 
            greater than those of running outside.</li>
        <li>Takes up space in homes.</li>
    </ul>
