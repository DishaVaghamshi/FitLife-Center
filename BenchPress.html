    <p>The bench press is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the 
        trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. 
        The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, 
        among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, 
        but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.</p>
